   LITERATURE SURVEY 
 
2.1 Existing Systems 
Current food ordering platforms offer comprehensive services for browsing food, placing 
orders, and real-time delivery tracking. However, these systems are complex, commercial-scale 
applications with deep integrations and heavy infrastructure requirements. For small, homemade 
food businesses or academic simulations, such advanced platforms are often not feasible or 
necessary. Many smaller vendors or students attempting similar projects rely on static websites 
or limited backend support, which restricts functionality and user experience. 
These basic systems often do not support user authentication, secure login mechanisms, real-
time database updates, or interactive order tracking. Features like email verification, seamless 
UI/UX, or modern frontend technologies are often absent. Additionally, there’s minimal use of 
cloud-backed services or scalable databases, making it difficult to simulate an end-to-end 
ordering process in a clean, secure, and modular way. Hence, there's a significant gap between 
the professional-level systems and the simplistic prototypes built for academic purposes. 
 
2.2 Limitations of Existing Systems 
The limitations of current offline or desktop-based medical store systems include: 
1. No Real-Time User Management: 
o Existing student or prototype systems often lack real-time syncing of user actions like 
login status, cart updates, or order placement. This can lead to a broken or 
inconsistent user experience. 
2. Poor UI/UX: 
o Many systems have outdated and non-intuitive interfaces, requiring extensive 
training for new staff members. This not only reduces productivity but also increases 
the chances of operational errors during peak hours. 
3. Weak Authentication or Security: 
o Many systems skip proper authentication or rely on basic localStorage-based 
solutions. Without secure sign-up/login features or email confirmation, these systems 
are not secure or reliable for real users. 
4. Lack of Simulated Real-World Features: 


--- Page 12 ---
 
xii 
 
o Features such as order tracking, favorites, or real payment simulations (like UPI) are 
generally missing. These are essential for creating an engaging and realistic user 
journey. 
 
2.3 Proposed System 
The proposed system, Mumma’s Kitchen, is a dynamic and responsive web application 
designed to simulate a real-world food ordering experience. The platform overcomes the 
limitations of traditional static systems by offering cloud-enabled functionality, secure 
authentication, and real-time database interactions. The system is fully accessible on desktop 
and mobile browsers and aims to provide users with a seamless journey—from exploring dishes 
to placing and tracking orders. 
Key features of the proposed system include: 
1. Real-Time order and Inventory Updates: 
o The application uses Supabase (a Firebase alternative) to handle real-time data 
syncing for cart operations, order placements, and product availability. This ensures 
a smooth and consistent experience for users across devices. 
2. User-Friendly Interface: 
o The application features an intuitive and responsive interface, optimized for mobile 
devices. This allows staff to navigate the system with minimal training, speeding up 
service and reducing human error. 
3. Secure User Authentication with Email Verification: 
o Supabase authentication enables secure sign-up and login. A confirmation link is sent 
to the user’s email during registration, ensuring only verified users gain access to 
account-related features. 
4. Multiple Payment Options and Order Tracking: 
o Although it's a simulation, the platform mimics real functionality by allowing users 
to choose between UPI and Cash on Delivery (COD) and displays a basic order 
tracking feature to enhance realism. 
5. Comprehensive Reporting and Analytics: 
o The eMeds system offers advanced reporting features, including customizable reports 
on sales trends, inventory turnover, and financial summaries. These insights help 
store owners and managers make data-driven decisions and optimize operations.

(e.g., change prices, update descriptions), and delete items that are no longer 
offered. 


--- Page 14 ---
 
xiv 
 
o The admin dashboard should offer a live snapshot of ongoing orders, pending 
deliveries, inventory levels, and revenue summary. 
o Each menu item should be linked to inventory to track the availability of ingredients 
used in its preparation. 
4. Billing Module: 
o It should provide the customer with a digital receipt and store transaction records 
for future reference. The system should also allow for multiple payment methods, 
including cash on delivery, card payments (UPI), and mobile wallet solutions. 
o Integration with POS (Point-of-Sale) hardware, such as receipt printers and card 
readers, should be included for a smooth checkout experience. 
o The system should support split payments (e.g., for shared bills) and include a tip 
calculator for customer convenience. 
 
3.1.2 Non-Functional Requirements 
Non-functional requirements define the quality attributes of the system, ensuring that it performs 
effectively under various conditions and meets the expectations of both kitchen staff and
