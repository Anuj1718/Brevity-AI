Div : A 
Topic : Communication 
Objective : The objective of this module is to develop effective communication skills 
essential for leadership and personal growth. It emphasizes listening, clear communication, 
visionary thinking, structured planning, and impactful presentations. These skills are critical 
for becoming a confident, influential, and organized leader in both professional and personal 
spheres. 
1. The Importance of Listening Skills 
Listening is a fundamental part of communication, often more important than speaking. 
Listening skills involve giving full attention to the speaker, interpreting their message 
accurately, and responding appropriately. 
• 
Active Listening: Fully concentrating on what is being said rather than just passively 
hearing the message. 
• 
Empathetic Listening: Understanding the emotions behind the speaker’s words, 
showing sensitivity and compassion. 
• 
Reflective Listening: Restating or paraphrasing what the speaker has said to confirm 
understanding. 
Importance: 
• 
Helps build trust and rapport with others. 
• 
Minimizes misunderstandings and conflicts. 
• 
Encourages open communication in teams and relationships.

Techniques: 
• 
Maintain eye contact and an attentive posture. 
• 
Avoid interrupting or judging. 
• 
Ask clarifying questions and summarize points for confirmation. 
 Example: 
Imagine yourself sitting in a team meeting where one of your team members is openly 
explaining a problem they are presently facing. If you choose to cut them off in the middle of 
their train of thought or do not provide your undivided attention to what they are expressing, 
there's a high likelihood that you might miss important details that are crucial to the issue at 
hand. But if you practice active listening and respond thoughtfully by stating, "So you're saying 
the deadline is too tight because of the new changes?"  not only does this show that you have 
understood the crux of their issue, but it also reflects that you are actually concerned about the 
issue at hand. Such interaction creates a more robust and unified team environment, promoting 
cooperation and mutual support among team members. 
 
2. The 7 C's of Communication 
The 7 C’s provide a checklist for effective communication. Following these principles ensures 
that messages are delivered clearly and received as intended. 
1. Clarity: Use clear and simple language. Avoid jargon or ambiguous terms. 
2. Conciseness: Stick to the point. Eliminate unnecessary words without losing meaning. 
3. Correctness: Ensure grammar, spelling, and facts are accurate. 
4. Completeness: Provide all necessary information to avoid confusion or follow-ups. 
5. Concreteness: Be specific and use examples or data to support points. 
6. Courtesy: Show respect and consider the receiver’s feelings and perspective. 
7. Consideration: Customize the message for the audience’s background, expectations, 
and needs.

3. Vision and Charisma 
Effective leaders often possess a vision for the future and the charisma to inspire others to 
follow them. 
• 
Vision refers to a clear picture of future success or goals. It helps guide decision-making 
and provides direction to the team. 
• 
A visionary leader communicates their vision with passion and motivates others to align 
with it. 
• 
Charisma is a personal quality that attracts and influences others through charm, 
confidence, and authenticity. 
• 
Charismatic leaders often display optimism, strong communication skills, and a 
compelling presence. 
Together, vision and charisma help leaders build trust, rally support, and create a strong impact 
on their followers. 
4. Planning and Organizing Communication 
Before you speak or write, planning helps ensure your message is effective. 
1. Strategic Planning: 
• Be specific regarding your goal: What particular action or piece of information do you 
want the listener to do or know? 
• Know your audience: Are they students, customers, teammates? 
• Choose the correct tone: Formal, friendly, informative? 
 
2. Organizing: 
Employ a clearly defined and readily accessible framework: 
1. Introduction – Say your purpose 
2. Body – Expand and support your points in detail. 
3. Conclusion – Summarize and suggest action

Example: When you are giving a business presentation to a crowd, beginning with a clear 
statement such as, "Today, I would like to speak about our customer service improvements," 
serves to nicely establish the context and leads people to more clearly understand what they 
can expect to hear from you during the course of your presentation. 
5. Breaking Down Complex Tasks into Actionable Steps 
At times we find ourselves faced with ideas or projects that are just too daunting and 
overwhelming to approach or tackle as a whole, all at one time. Successful communicators can 
take these great challenges and break them down into smaller, more manageable parts. 
Reasons for Its Benefits: 
1. Minimizes vagueness 
2. Helps people to understand what a given activity or step must be done in order to 
accomplish a specific objective. 
3. Renders goals more reachable 
 Instructions: 
1. Start by clearly stating the overall goal that you want to attain. 
2. Break it down into smaller, more manageable pieces or components. 
3. Allocate specific tasks along with their corresponding timelines for completion. 
4. Clearly state who does what 
6. Presentation Skills:  
Whether it is a speech, project presentation, or class presentation, good presentation skills make 
your message heard. 
Core Components:  
1. Preparation: Get to know your topic very well. Prepare for questions to be asked. 
2. Organization: Should have a definite beginning, middle, and end. 
3. Visuals: Ensure you have slides, images, or videos to complement and enhance the 
effect of your oral remarks. 
4. Delivery: Speak clearly, maintain eye contact, use body language.  
5. Engagement: Provoke active audience participation through challenging questions, 
inspirational stories, and encouraging involvement.

In the journey of leadership and personality development, communication is a core pillar. 
Whether it's through active listening, clear and courteous messaging, visionary inspiration, 
structured task management, or impactful presentations, each skill contributes to a leader’s 
ability to influence and lead effectively. Developing these communication competencies helps 
individuals grow as confident leaders who can drive change, inspire others, and achieve 
meaningful success both personally and professionally.
